Nasty, brutish, and short, Mr. Dodson (a cunning alias) is known to reside in Somerville, Massachusetts. Although he would have you believe that he is a simple <span class="sc">librarian</span>, he is, in fact, guilty of innumerable acts of <span class="sc">web design, audio production, writing,</span> and <span class="sc">editing</span>. He discloses trade secrets at techneblog.com and scandalizes the reading public with his "arts &amp; letters" journal, <em>Printer's Devil Review</em>. He should be considered for your next project.</p></article>
